# get_them_jobs
This is a Python program that retrieves new job postings from a university's co-op portal,
organizes the information, and sends it to the user via SMS message using the Twilio library.
The SMS message includes details about the job, such as the position title, employer, and location.
This program is designed to help students find co-op and internship opportunities and stay informed about new job openings
